# HDB Planner

React + TypeScript planner for Singapore HDB new-flat planning.

- Estimated loan eligibility from household income.
- Enhanced CPF Housing Grant lookup for first-timer families.
- Downpayment, option fee, survey fee, and fire insurance scenarios.
- Average payment timeline estimates from application through key collection.
- Flat-size-specific BTO comparisons from the generated RecordBTO backfill.
- Browser-local scenario saving with JSON import/export for tester handoff.

## Structure

- [`frontend`](frontend): Vite React app.
- [`backend`](backend): data refresh scripts and local policy source documents.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install --prefix frontend
npm.cmd run dev
```

## Check The App

```bash
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

## Saved Scenarios

The Purchase Plan page lets users save a scenario in browser `localStorage`,
download it as JSON, and load a previously exported JSON file. No account or
server storage is required.

## Refresh BTO Data

```bash
npm.cmd run data:recordbto
```

This replaces `frontend/public/data/recordbto/projects.json` with the current
RecordBTO project scrape. The scraper is dependency-free and uses the project
count reported by `https://recordbto.com/bto`.

## Deploy

The root [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) is configured for a repository where the
Vite app is inside `frontend`.

### Vercel Dashboard

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, choose **Add New... > Project** and import the GitHub repository.
3. Keep the project root as the repository root so Vercel reads
   [`vercel.json`](vercel.json).
4. Confirm these build settings:

```text
Framework Preset: Vite
Install Command: npm install --prefix frontend
Build Command: npm run build --prefix frontend
Output Directory: frontend/dist
```

5. Deploy. After the first production deployment, share the production URL with
   testers.

If a deployment URL returns `401 Unauthorized`, Vercel Deployment Protection is
enabled for the project or team. In Vercel, open the project settings and set
Deployment Protection to **None** for deployments you want public testers to
open.

### Before Sharing

Run the production build locally:

```bash
npm.cmd run build
```

If BTO data needs to be refreshed before deployment, regenerate it instead of
editing the generated JSON:

```bash
npm.cmd run data:recordbto
```

## Policy Maintenance

Policy constants are centralized in
[`frontend/src/policies/policyConfig.ts`](frontend/src/policies/policyConfig.ts).

When updating policy values:

1. Review the listed official source pages and local PDFs.
2. Update the relevant constants.
3. Set `lastVerified` to the review date.
4. Run `npm.cmd run lint` and `npm.cmd run build`.
